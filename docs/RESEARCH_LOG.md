## 2026-10-08: Project setup (week 1, day 1)

- **What:** Read the professor's InlayFake brief. Scope agreed with the author: both detector study and
  forensic origin detection ("traditional" = off-the-shelf detectors **and** hand-crafted forensics,
  plus learned forensic baselines). Target: CVPR 2027 (submission 16 Nov 2026 AoE per official CFP
  via search; confirm, including the registration date).
- **Decisions:**
  - 5-week plan: benchmark + baseline study (the brief's suggested "constrained first paper"). Stage 2
    (VLM captions) reduced to P1.
  - Source pool = COCO val2017 (unseen by COCO-trained detectors).
  - Generators: SDXL-Inpainting, SD-2-Inpainting (seen); FLUX.1-Fill-dev (held out).
  - Verifier for insertions = OWLv2, excluded from the evaluated detectors to avoid selection bias.
  - Identical JPEG q=95 encoding for C1–C5 to remove format shortcuts.
- **Created:** AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, PRD.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, paper/PAPER.md, config and ledger
  schema.
- **Open:** laptop GPU model and VRAM; professor sign-off on the scope.
- **Next:** COCO download + `sample` and `plan` stages; generator wrapper for G1; 50-source pilot.
